* List of claims
  /This list should list all claims made in the paper, referencing the/
  /claim in the paper, the portion in the artifact evaluating that/
  /claim, and evaluation instructions for evaluating that claim./

  1. Theorem 6.4 claims that forward-completeness suffices for
     associativity of evidence composition and that there exists a
     generalized Coq mechanization of this property.

  2. Theorem 7.4 claims a bound for the size of evidence composition
     in the BRR language.  The height bounds in Lemma 7.3 and Theorem
     7.4 are proven in Coq.
