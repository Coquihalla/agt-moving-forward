* List of claims
  /This list should list all claims made in the paper, referencing the/
  /claim in the paper, the portion in the artifact evaluating that/
  /claim, and evaluation instructions for evaluating that claim./

  1. Theorem 6.4 claims that forward-completeness suffices for
     associativity of evidence composition and that there exists a
     generalized Coq mechanization of this property.

  2. Theorem 7.4 claims a bound for the size of evidence composition
     in the BRR language.  The height bounds in Lemma 7.3 and Theorem
     7.4 are proven in Coq.

** Section 6
   This section has been mechanized in file
   agt/AGT_Spec.v:

   - Definition 6.1 (forward completeness) corresponds to
     ~Parameter gamma_completeness~.
   - Theorem 6.4 (associativity of evidence composition) corresponds
     to ~Theorem ct_assoc~.
** Section 7
  - Lemma 7.1 (Bound for size of Gradual Types in BRR)
    corresponds to ~Lemma height_bound~.
  - Definition 7.2 (Size and height of evidences in BRR)
    has three parts:
    - Part 1 (size of evidences) corresponds to
      ~Definition size_ev~.
    - Part 2 (height of evidences) corresponds to
      ~Definition height_ev~.
    - Part 3 (label domain of evidences) corresponds to
      ~Definition domain_ev~.
  - Theorem 7.3 (Height bounds in BRR) has three parts:
    - Part 1 (bound for meet) corresponds to 
      ~Lemma height_meet~.
    - Part 2 (bound for initial evidence) corresponds to 
      ~Lemma I_bound~.
    - Part 3 (bound for composition) corresponds to
      ~Lemma ec_bound_height~.
  - Theorem 7.4 corresponds to ~Theorem ec_bound_size~.
